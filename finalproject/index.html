	JNL 221: Analyzing COVID-19 in the United States

  <p>
Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is an infectious disease that is caused by the SARS–CoV-2 virus.
</p>

<p>
COVID-19 emerged in December of 2019 in China. The disease spread rapidly to other countries around the world within weeks. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, 2020. And on March 11 2020, the outbreak was declared as a pandemic.
</p>

<p>
Those who may have contracted COVID-19 may experience a variety of different symptoms. These include fever or chills, coughing, headache, sore throat and more. The CDC says treatment of symptoms include over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol and Advil.
</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
<p>
While case numbers and death rates are declining around the world and in the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet. It is important to take a look at these trends over time.
</p>

<p>
The state of New York continues to monitor COVID-19 cases and deaths. Testing centers are still available throughout the United States. New York City, especially, has testing centers spread throughout its five boroughs. This article analyzes COVID-19 cases and death rates over time, specifically looking at how New York City has been impacted.

    These graphs demonstrate the number of COVID-19 deaths in New York City every year since the start of the pandemic in 2020. New York City had a total of 20,324 COVID-19 deaths in 2020. In this year, April was the month that had the most deaths (nearly 13,000). 
  </p>
  </div>
</script>
  </div>
<p>
  <br>
In 2021, there were 9,867 total COVID-19 deaths in New York City, with January and February having the most deaths. The death numbers began to gradually decrease once vaccines were introduced to the city in April of 2021. 
</p>

<p>
In 2022, there were 7,456 total COVID-19 deaths in New York City. Again, January and February were the months with the most deaths, but these numbers drop dramatically starting in March and going throughout the summer. These numbers start to slightly increase going into the winter season in November and December. 
</p>

<p>
Overall, COVID-19 deaths have dropped nearly 63% since the start of the pandemic from 2020 to 2022. COVID-19 death rates drop during the spring and summer months, but increase during the winter months. But 2020 still remains the year that had the most COVID-19 deaths in New York City. There were nearly 38,000 toal COVID-19 deaths from 2020 to 2022.

  What can the drop in COVID-19 death rates be attributed to?
</header>

<p>
  Associate Teaching Professor Lisa Olson-Gugerty (Professor OG) teaches undergraduate courses at Syracuse University that focus on health promotion, health and disease, and healthcare administration. She says that there are many reasons as to why COVID-19 death rates have dropped dramatically. One reason is the fact that COVID-19 has mutated multiple times, and continues to mutate.
</p>

<p>
  "The mutations have led to a less deadly virus," Professor OG said. "Additionally, as it has mutated, it has affected different populations.  When younger, healthier individuals are the ones getting the virus they tend to survive."
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
<P>
  Professor OG also said that 81% of Americans have received the COVID-19 vaccine, which also contributes to the dramatic drop in deaths.
</P>

<p>
  "For a while, most Americans who were dying of the coronavirus were unvaccinated," she said. "But more recently, that isn’t the case. We have a slightly better understanding of how to treat the disease. We are not scrambling as much to understand how to treat it."
</p>

<p>
  But even though death rates have dropped and continue to drop, this doesn't mean that COVID-19 is going away. In fact, according to Professor OG, the world is entering into a "new norm."

  "We will continue to have people test positive, and die from the disease but there should be less of this," she said. "I would offer that this is similar to the flu."

As of February 2021, these were all the COVID-19 testing locations in New York City by borough. These locations were all schools in New York City that were offering COVID-19 testing. The NYC Department of Education provided this data so that the public was aware of which schools throughout the five boroughs were offering testing. Brooklyn and Queens had the largest number of testing locations, while Staten Island had the least. There are still COVID-19 testing locations that can be found in New York City.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:

<p>
  Marie Achkar is a sophomore at Syracuse University studying broadcast and digital journalism at the Newhouse School. Since she was a freshman in college, Marie has been curious about how the number of COVID-19 deaths have fluctuated -- especially in the most densely populated major city in the United States. She plans to move to New York City after graduation and wanted to further analyze how the pandemic impacted the city and how these numbers have changed since 2020.
